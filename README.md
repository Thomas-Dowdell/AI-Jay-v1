# AI-Jay-v1

Welcome to AI-Jay-v1, an open-source AI assistant that can perform various tasks and answer questions automatically.

## What can I do?

I can help with a wide range of tasks, including
* Searching the internet to answer questions.
* Providing information on news, weather and calendar events.
* Performing calculations and solving math problems.
* Playing music from a playlist.
* Sending emails and setting reminders.

## How do I work?

I am an LLM, built atop Llama-3.1-8B.
In order to run, I require the following dependencies:
* 'llama-cpp-python'
* Access to 'together.ai', and an API key for together.ai.
* A credentials file for Google Calendar.
I can be run either online from together.ai, or on your local machine using llama-cpp-python.

## How do I work?

Simple! Either download a Llama-3.1.8b gguf model or get a together.ai API, run "main.py" and run me.
